# YouToddler Spring Server

YouToddler Spring Boot Server - 2nd generation. 

This is a Swagger generated server.

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springdoc-openapi](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi)


Start your server as a simple java application.

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:9090/

Get the full documentation from http://localhost:9090/api/v1/api-docs or from the [Confluence page](https://manhatten.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AT/pages/7110657/OpenAPI+documentation#The-Swagger-YAML)

Change default port value in application.properties
