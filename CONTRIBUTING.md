## Create an Issue

If you find a bug — _and you don’t know how to fix it_, **create an issue** on our Jira Backlog. Don't assign it to a sprint until it's review by the TL.

_or — even better_ fix it yourself!

## Create a Pull Request

If you know how to fix the issue yourself, submit a pull request with the proposed changes.

Here's what to do:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a new branch.
  1. Make sure you are on `master`
  2. `git pull`
  3. `git checkout -b users/<yourgithubname>/<branchname>` So for example `users/cant0r/hotfixing-toddler` 
4. Make your changes on the new branch.
5. Commit your changes in logical chunks.
6. Push your branch to remote. `git push`
7. Open a pull request.
